<h3 style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;" >HOW DOES THE INTERNET WORK?</h3>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">There are two main concepts that are fundamental to the way the Internet functions: packets and protocols</p>
<br>
<h4 style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">PACKETS</h4>
<P style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each packet contains both data and information about that data.
     The information about the packet's contents is known as the "header," and it goes at the front of the packet so that the receiving 
     machine knows what to do with the packet. To understand the purpose of a packet header, think of how some consumer products come 
     with assembly instructions.</P>
     <p style="font-family: sans-serif;background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first broken up into smaller packets, which are then translated into bits. The packets
         get routed to their destination by various networking devices such as routers and switches. When the packets arrive at their destination,
          the receiving device reassembles the packets in order and can then use or display the data.</p>
          <p style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">Packets are sent across the Internet using a technique called packet switching. Intermediary routers and switches are able to process
             packets independently from each other, without accounting for their source or destination. This is by design so that no single 
             connection dominates the network. If data was sent between computers all at once with no packet switching, a connection between 
             two computers could occupy multiple cables, routers, and switches for minutes at a time. Essentially, only two people would be able to
              use the Internet at a time — instead of an almost unlimited number of people, as is the case in reality.</p>

<h4 style="font-family: sans-serif;background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">PROTOCOLS</h4>
<P style="font-family: sans-serif;background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of doing certain actions and formatting data so that two or more devices
are able to communicate with and understand each other.</P>
 <P style="font-family: sans-serif; background-color: rgba(240, 248, 255, 0.482); background-size: 2px;">There are protocols for sending packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet), for sending packets from network to network (IP),
for ensuring those packets successfully arrive in order (TCP), and for formatting data for websites and applications (HTTP). In addition  to these foundational protocols, there are also protocols for routing, testing, and encryption. And there are alternatives to the protocols
listed above for different types of content — for instance, streaming video often uses UDP instead of TCP.</P>
